\title{Inverse 1D Wavelet Transform}
\usage{
wt_inverse_1d(coeff_vec, map)
}
\arguments{
\item{coeff_vec}{Numeric vector of flattened wavelet coefficients}

\item{map}{List containing transform metadata from wt_forward_1d()}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of length P representing the reconstructed signal
}
\description{
Reconstructs original signal from wavelet coefficients using the waveslim package.
This is the inverse operation of wt_forward_1d().
}
\details{
The function reconstructs the original signal by:
\enumerate{
\item Reorganizing coefficients back into the waveslim dwt format
\item Applying the inverse discrete wavelet transform
\item Returning the reconstructed signal
}
}
\examples{
y <- rnorm(64)
result <- wt_forward_1d(y, wf = "la8", J = 4)
reconstructed <- wt_inverse_1d(result$coeff, result$map)
all.equal(y, reconstructed)  # Should be TRUE
}
