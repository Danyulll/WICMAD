\title{Forward 1D Wavelet Transform}
\usage{
wt_forward_1d(y, wf = "la8", J = NULL, boundary = "periodic")
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Numeric vector of length P representing the input signal}

\item{wf}{Character string specifying the wavelet filter (default: "la8")}

\item{J}{Integer specifying the number of decomposition levels (default: NULL, auto-determined)}

\item{boundary}{Character string specifying boundary condition (default: "periodic")}
}
\value{
List containing:
\item{coeff}{Numeric vector of flattened wavelet coefficients}
\item{map}{List containing transform metadata (J, wf, boundary, P, idx)}
}
\description{
Performs forward discrete wavelet transform on a 1D signal using the waveslim package.
Returns wavelet coefficients in a flattened vector format with indexing information.
}
\details{
The function uses the waveslim package to perform the wavelet transform
and reorganizes the output into a flattened coefficient vector with proper indexing.
The map object contains all necessary information for reconstruction.
}
\examples{
y <- rnorm(64)
result <- wt_forward_1d(y, wf = "la8", J = 4)
reconstructed <- wt_inverse_1d(result$coeff, result$map)
}
