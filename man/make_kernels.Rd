\title{Create Collection of Kernel Functions}
\usage{
make_kernels(add_bias_variants = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{add_bias_variants}{Logical indicating whether to include bias variants of base kernels (default: TRUE)}
}
\value{
List of kernel configurations, each containing:
\item{name}{Character string identifying the kernel}
\item{fun}{Function that computes the kernel matrix}
\item{pnames}{Character vector of parameter names}
\item{prior}{Function that computes log prior density}
\item{pstar}{Function that samples from prior}
\item{prop_sd}{List of proposal standard deviations for MCMC}
}
\description{
Creates a collection of kernel functions with their associated priors and proposal distributions.
Includes base kernels (SE, Mat32, Mat52, Periodic) and optionally their bias variants.
}
\details{
The function creates both base kernels and their bias variants. Base kernels include
Squared Exponential (SE), Matérn 3/2, Matérn 5/2, and Periodic kernels. Bias variants add
a constant term to handle non-zero mean functions.
}
\examples{
# Get all kernels including bias variants
kernels <- make_kernels(add_bias_variants = TRUE)

# Get only base kernels
base_kernels <- make_kernels(add_bias_variants = FALSE)
}
