\title{ICM Likelihood Computation for Single Curve}
\usage{
fast_icm_loglik_curve(y_resid, cache)
}
\arguments{
\item{y_resid}{Matrix of residuals (P x M) where P is number of time points and M is number of channels}

\item{cache}{Cache object from .build_icm_cache() containing precomputed eigendecompositions and Cholesky factors}
}
\value{
Numeric scalar representing the log-likelihood value
}
\description{
Computes the log-likelihood for a single curve using precomputed cache from
.build_icm_cache(). Uses the block diagonal structure for efficient computation.
}
\details{
The function computes the log-likelihood using the formula:
-0.5 * (P * M * log(2Ï€) + logdet_sum + quadratic_form)
where the quadratic form is computed efficiently using precomputed Cholesky factors
for each eigenvalue block in the block diagonal structure.
}
\examples{
# Assuming cache is built and y_resid is available
loglik <- fast_icm_loglik_curve(y_resid, cache)
}
